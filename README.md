# 100-days-coding

Repository used to store projects done as part of a 100 Days of Coding (Python) challenge.

These projects have been inspired by an Angela Yu's Python course. Even though I have followed her lessons in order to learn new things and tricks where needed, I have tried to autonomously solve the propose projects and code challenges on my own by checking out documentation and other souces first, which has allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge by getting "hands dirty", even though at times I felt like throwing my laptop out of the window.

Since I'm a Spanish native speaker, the projects are commented in Spanish and made thinking of a Spanish-speaker user, however, if anyone would like me to translate any of these projects, I'd be happy to do so, just reach out and I can do this for you :)
