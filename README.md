# 100-days-coding


Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding repository! üêç

This is where I've stored projects from my early programming journey, inspired by Angela Yu's Python course. 

Though I've ventured into full-time JS work since then, this challenge remains a cherished memory. 

Highly recommend Angela's course for anyone diving into programming.
