# 100-days-coding

Repository used to store projects done as part of a 100 Days of Coding (Python) challenge.

These projects have been inspired by an Angela Yu's Python course. Even though I have followed her lessons in order to learn new things and tricks where needed, I have tried to autonomously solve the proposed projects and code challenges on my own by checking out documentation and other souces first, which has allowed me to gain lots of knowledge and to improve my skills :)
