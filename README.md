# 100-days-coding

Repository used to store projects done as part of a 100 Days of Coding (Python) challenge.

These projects have been inspired by an Angela Yu's Python course. Even though I have followed her lessons in order to learn new things and tricks where needed, I have tried to autonomously solve the proposed projects and code challenges on my own by checking out documentation and other souces first, which has allowed me to gain lots of knowledge and to improve my skills.

I'm a Spanish native speaker, and it's easier for me to practice using my native tongue. Therefore, the projects are commented in Spanish and made thinking of a potential Spanish-speaker user. However, I'm currently in the process of translating these projects so the code can be understood by a wider audience and once that's done I'll try my very best to keep using English instead of Spanish :)
